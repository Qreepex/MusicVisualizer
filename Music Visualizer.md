# *Music Visualizer*
____

#
### **How**
This **Music Visualizer** is based on **Particles**, these particles are spawned based on the **volume** of the current sound.

#
### **Keys**
Key | Do |
--- | ---
**ESC** | stop
**p** | pause
**shift** | unpause
**space** | delete Particles
**scroll** | spawn Particles at Cursor
**mouse press** | shoot Particles in direction
**1-9** |  manual Spawn Particles

#
### **Use**
When you run the Programm you need to enter the path to a **WAV**-file. \
Any other file format is highly unlikely to not work at all. \
When you made it the song will play and you can watch the show, and use the Keys. \
After the Song has ended, the programm will stop it self. \
Also, you can set a custim Background by putting a png with the name "Background" in the Folder where the MusicVisualizer.py is.
